# Nonparametric Modeling Project

In this study, we investigated the application of mean-shift algorithm and random forests for unsupervised clustering. Additionally, we employed dimensionality reduction techniques, ISOMAP, to enhance clustering performance by capturing non-linear relationships and reducing noise. The results demonstrated clustering outcomes with distinct values observed in the clusters. The mean-shift algorithm showed stability in assigning data points to clusters, while the random forests approach exhibited room for improvement in terms of stability. However, after revealing that the dataset consists of 10 hand-written digits, it became apparent that the mean-shift algorithm yielded poorer clustering results compared to random forests. The mean-shift algorithm produced 21 clusters, which significantly exceeded the expected 10 clusters. In conclusion, Our findings highlighted the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction in enhancing unsupervised data analysis and emphasize the importance of further advancements in the stability of random forests clustering.
